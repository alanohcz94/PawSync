Build a web application MVP called PawSync. It is a trainer-led single source of truth system for pet training homework.

Core workflow (must work end-to-end):
Trainer assigns homework → Owner submits completion with proof → Trainer reviews on a timeline and comments.

Tech Stack (required)

Next.js (App Router)

Pure JavaScript only (NO TypeScript anywhere)

TailwindCSS

PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM

NextAuth (Auth.js) with Google OAuth

Media upload for proof: image/video (simple dev-friendly implementation). Store uploaded files locally in a /public/uploads or similar dev path and store file metadata in the database. Keep it working in Replit.

Non-Functional Requirement (must follow)

Mobile-first responsive UI

Must work well at 360px–430px widths (phone sizes) and scale up to desktop.

No horizontal scrolling on core pages.

Use cards/lists for mobile (avoid tables that overflow).

Large tap targets and readable spacing.

Test with responsive layout assumptions.

Roles (simple)

Two roles: "TRAINER" and "OWNER"

Store role on user record

After first login, if role not set, show a role selection onboarding screen.

Database Models (Prisma)

Create these models:

User

id (string/uuid)

email (unique)

name (optional)

role (string: "TRAINER" or "OWNER", nullable until onboarding)

createdAt

Pet

id

name

species (optional)

ownerId (FK -> User)

trainerId (FK -> User)

createdAt

HomeworkTask

id

petId (FK)

createdByTrainerId (FK -> User)

title

instructions

frequency (string e.g. "daily", "3x/week", "weekly")

expectedDurationMins (int optional)

isActive (boolean default true)

createdAt

HomeworkSubmission

id

taskId (FK)

submittedByUserId (FK -> User)

note (text optional)

submittedAt (datetime)

status (string; MVP use "COMPLETED" only)

createdAt

SubmissionMedia

id

submissionId (FK)

mediaType ("IMAGE" or "VIDEO")

filePath (string)

fileName (optional)

createdAt

TrainerComment

id

submissionId (FK)

trainerId (FK -> User)

comment (text)

createdAt

Pages / Features (Phase 1 ONLY)

Do NOT implement Phase 2 features (feedback form, community chat, meds, grooming automation, external calendar sync, notifications, payments, AI).

Landing / Auth

Landing page with “Sign in with Google”

After login redirect to dashboard

Onboarding (Role Selection)

If role is null, prompt user to select TRAINER or OWNER and save.

Dashboard (mobile-first)

If OWNER: list pets owned by user + button “Add Pet”

If TRAINER: list pets assigned to trainer

Select a pet to open pet workspace

Pet Management
OWNER can:

Create a pet (name, optional species)

Assign a trainer by entering trainer email (must match an existing user email; if not found show clear error)

TRAINER can:

View assigned pets (read-only)

Homework Tasks
TRAINER can:

Create homework task for selected pet (title, instructions, frequency, expected duration)
OWNER can:

View active homework tasks for selected pet

Homework Submission
OWNER can:

Mark task as completed

Add a short note

Upload optional image or video

Save submission + media metadata

View submission history per task

Timeline / Calendar View (critical)
Provide a timeline view per pet showing chronological items:

Tasks created (assigned)

Submissions (completed)

Trainer comments
Include basic weekly grouping (e.g., “This Week”, “Last Week” or grouped by week start date).
This is a review timeline, not reminders.

Trainer Review & Comment
TRAINER can:

Open a submission detail

Add a comment tied to that submission
OWNER can:

View trainer comments

API Routes (Next.js route handlers)

Implement simple REST endpoints with basic validation:

GET/POST /api/pets

GET/POST /api/tasks (filter by petId)

GET/POST /api/submissions (filter by taskId or petId)

GET /api/submissions/[id]

POST /api/submissions/[id]/comment

POST /api/upload (accept multipart form data, save file, return filePath + mediaType)

UI Requirements

Clean, minimal, mobile-first layout using Tailwind.

Use cards and stacked layouts for mobile.

Basic loading and error states.

Avoid complex state management; keep it simple.

Deliverable (must be working)

I must be able to:

Sign in as trainer or owner

Set role on first login

Owner creates pet and assigns trainer email

Trainer creates homework task for pet

Owner submits completion with note + optional media

Trainer reviews timeline and comments on a submission

Owner sees trainer comment

README

Include README.md with:

env vars: DATABASE_URL, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL

Prisma migration steps

How to run the app

Notes to Replit AI

Prefer simple implementations over abstractions. Keep code readable and organized. Ensure the project builds and runs.
